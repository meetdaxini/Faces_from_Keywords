
# Faces From Keywords

This was the final project of the Coursera [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/C2XVUU6PXKBY). I was given zip files containing images of newspapers. For the project we had to unzip them using zipfile module and then character recognition for given keywords in newspaper clips using pytesseract module. If the keyword was found in the image then we have to do face recognition in that newspaper clip using Pillow, Numpy and Opencv modules and build contact sheet of all the faces found. In order to complete the project, I had to read documentations of these modules as well as ask questions on stackoverflow to understand the proper use of these models.
